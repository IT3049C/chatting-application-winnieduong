## Discussion Questions:
1. What does the bootstrap `display-4` class do?
The Bootstrap `.display-4` class is a display heading that creates a large, prominent text style, smaller than `.display-1`, `.display-2`, and `.display-3`. It features a larger font size and lighter font-weight than standard headings, making it ideal for hero sections and standout text elements.
